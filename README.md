# Tamagotchi-app
My second assignment
A Tamagotchi app is a game that was mostly played in the early 19th century. The Tamagotchi is a game that also test your care, when playing the game, you need to take care of the pet in the game, it includes washing or cleaning the pet, playing and have fun with the pet through mini games or activities, feeding the pet before or after playing. It also allows you to share moments, it can bring up the environments or any other social features. The app is a great way to teach kids to care for their pets, it is a great way to teach kids about other animals or pets, it is also a fun and simple game to play.
I think the purpose of this app is to test my abilities of creating an app compared to the first project. The purpose of this app is to create my very own Tamagotchi app which includes taking care of the pet as mentioned in the above paragraph/introduction, the app should include the health of the pet, the energy or playfulness status of the pet and the cleanness of the pet making sure that the pet doesn’t die from hunger or not being taken care of. This is an enjoyable app mostly for kids.
Designing this app was a bit difficult compared to the first history app. For the creation of this app, I first ran the emulator, I then opened my android studio and used Kotlin language. Before I declared anything I ran the app then I added the drawable images of my pet which was a dog. I linked up my activities using the help of YouTube videos and the module manual for example “
Val Intent = Intent (this, MainActivity2:: class java)
startActivity (Intent)”
 by coding this it will eventually activate and link to the next activity when pressing the start button on the welcome page. For my welcome page I tried to use a bright image so that it could be attractive and have a warm welcome by saying “Hey Buddy” by that already you have an interest in playing or seeing what’s going to happen when you press the start button. On my second main activity I declared my 3 buttons which I called “Fun, Eat, and Clean” same as play, feed and clean like stated in the instructions, I also declared my Image views along with my progress bars. I also used the “if” statements. I tried using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) strategy.
According to the faculty of ICT GitHub guide [2024] “git helps you keep your work organized, you can have different versions of your work for different projects, all separated from each other.”
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control repositories. In other words, GitHub is a website that hosts your repositories online the advantage of GitHub is that you can keep you work there and can access it whenever you want even if it’s not your computer. You can always customize your profile onsite, and it is very useful when having group works or applying for jobs.
As I was creating and designing my app, I did encounter some problems I first had problems linking up my main activities but then that got fixed. On my app there only one button work which is the “Eat” button where as the clean and fun don’t work. I tried adding toasts and comments as a way of scoring marks, but overall I really wished it worked cause I tried putting up the brightest images to make it attractive.
